## run the demo

download dataset from: http://researchdata.gla.ac.uk/id/eprint/270

compress and move it to home directory i.e. ~/clothes_dataset_RH

run demo.m

If you want to duplicate the same result in our paper, you need to use high-recolution by setting para.sensor = 'RH' in extract_feature_main_script.m
